                I love to learn and I continually seek to understand the world I live in.

                Atomic Physics. My interest in programming came from my love for video games. I would love to

                I spend most of my time watching Movies, TV shows, Football Matches and YouTube and playing Video Games. 
            One of my favorite movies is <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/?ref_fn_al_tt_2"><b>The Shawshank Redemption</b></a>.
            TV show genres that I like include sitcoms, satirical animations and fantasies. Mostly on YouTube I watch
            commentary channels, sports highlights, video game walkthroughs and art channels. Video Games is included in the 
            <a href="extra.html" target="_blank">Extra</a> page. I also occasssionally draw but I am not a well developed artist.

                 I am a novice web developer. I have goalkeeping experiences spanning over 5 years, with the record for most penalty saves in a single game 
                 at a game in my highschool match. I currently hold the most clean sheets in a football tournament. 
                 I have played basketball in highschool. <br>
                 I have experiences in programming languages such as python and java. I would say I am a novice
                 programmer. I took part in two projects over the last two semesters involving the aforementioned languages.
                I am an experienced Video Game player and a "certified" Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 LAN expert.
